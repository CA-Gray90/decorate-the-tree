Repository for working on my 'Decorate the Tree' game. 

A terminal game in which the user plays an Elf that must decorate the Christmas Tree.

The game uses a matrix to display the users position ('E') and the Grinchs
position ('G'). 

The user moves thier character position by entering commands into the console.
The commands are either 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'.

The Grinchs position changes automatically on each turn, moving towards the character.
The amount of moves Gollum makes is selected randomly between 0 - 2 for each turn.

The player can pick up decorations by passing over them. They can then drop them
off at the Tree by passing over the Tree.

If the player gets all decorations to the tree, they win. If they are caught by
the Grinch, they lose.

Work in progress.
